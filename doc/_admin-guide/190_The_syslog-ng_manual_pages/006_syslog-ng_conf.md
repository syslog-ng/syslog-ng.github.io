## SYNOPSIS

syslog-ng.conf

## DESCRIPTION

This manual page is only an abstract.

The {{ site.product.short_name }} application is a flexible and highly scalable system
logging application. Typically, {{ site.product.short_name }} is used to manage log
messages and implement centralized logging, where the aim is to collect
the log messages of several devices on a single, central log server. The
different devices - called {{ site.product.short_name }} clients - all run {{ site.product.short_name }},
and collect the log messages from the various applications, files, and
other sources. The clients send all important log messages to the remote
{{ site.product.short_name }} PE server, where the server sorts and stores them.

## BASIC CONCEPTS OF {{ site.product.short_name }}

The {{ site.product.short_name }} application reads incoming messages and forwards them
to the selected destinations. The {{ site.product.short_name }} application can receive
messages from files, remote hosts, and other sources.

Log messages enter {{ site.product.short_name }} in one of the defined sources, and are
sent to one or more destinations.

Sources and destinations are independent objects, log paths define what
{{ site.product.short_name }} does with a message, connecting the sources to the
destinations. A log path consists of one or more sources and one or more
destinations: messages arriving from a source are sent to every
destination listed in the log path. A log path defined in {{ site.product.short_name }}
is called a log statement.

Optionally, log paths can include filters. Filters are rules that select
only certain messages, for example, selecting only messages sent by a
specific application. If a log path includes filters, {{ site.product.short_name }}
sends only the messages satisfying the filter rules to the destinations
set in the log path.

Other optional elements that can appear in log statements are parsers
and rewriting rules. Parsers segment messages into different fields to
help processing the messages, while rewrite rules modify the messages by
adding, replacing, or removing parts of the messages.

## CONFIGURING {{ site.product.short_name }}

- The main body of the configuration file consists of object
    definitions: sources, destinations, logpaths define which log
    message are received and where they are sent. All identifiers,
    option names and attributes, and any other strings used in the
    {{ site.product.short_name }} configuration file are case sensitive. Object definitions
    (also called statements) have the following syntax:

    ```config
    type-of-the-object identifier-of-the-object {<parameters>};
    ```

  - Type of the object: One of source, destination, log, filter,
        parser, rewrite rule, or template.

  - Identifier of the object: A unique name identifying the object.
    When using a reserved word as an identifier, enclose the
    identifier in quotation marks (\"\").

    All identifiers, attributes, and any other strings used in the
    {{ site.product.short_name }} configuration file are case sensitive.

    **TIP:** Use identifiers that refer to the type of the object they
    identify. For example, prefix source objects with s\_,
    destinations with d\_, and so on.
    {: .notice--info}

    **NOTE:** Repeating a definition of an object (that is, defining the same
    object with the same id more than once) is not allowed, unless
    you use the @define allow-config-dups 1 definition in the
    configuration file.
    {: .notice--info}

  - Parameters: The parameters of the object, enclosed in braces
        {parameters}.

  - Semicolon: Object definitions end with a semicolon (;).

    For example, the following line defines a source and calls it
    s\_internal.

    ```config
    source s_internal { internal(); };
    ```

    The object can be later referenced in other statements using its ID,
    for example, the previous source is used as a parameter of the
    following log statement:

    ```config
    log { source(s_internal); destination(d_file); };
    ```

- The parameters and options within a statement are similar to
    function calls of the C programming language: the name of the option
    followed by a list of its parameters enclosed within brackets and
    terminated with a semicolon.

    ```config
    option(parameter1, parameter2); option2(parameter1, parameter2);
    ```

    For example, the file() driver in the following source statement has
    three options: the filename (/var/log/apache/access.log),
    follow-freq(), and flags(). The follow-freq() option also has a
    parameter, while the flags() option has two parameters.

    ```config
    source s_tail { file("/var/log/apache/access.log"
    follow-freq(1) flags(no-parse, validate-utf8)); };
    ```

    Objects may have required and optional parameters. Required
    parameters are positional, meaning that they must be specified in a
    defined order. Optional parameters can be specified in any order
    using the **option(value)** format. If a parameter (optional or
    required) is not specified, its default value is used. The
    parameters and their default values are listed in the reference
    section of the particular object.

    Example: Using required and optional parameters

    The unix-stream() source driver has a single required argument: the
    name of the socket to listen on. Optional parameters follow the
    socket name in any order, so the following source definitions have
    the same effect:

    ```config
    source s_demo_stream1 {
        unix-stream("<path-to-socket>" 
        max-connections(10) group(log)); 
    };

    source s_demo_stream2 {
        unix-stream("<path-to-socket>" 
        group(log) max-connections(10)); 
    };
    ```

- Some options are global options, or can be set globally, for
    example, whether {{ site.product.short_name }} should use DNS resolution to resolve
    IP addresses.

    ```config
    options { use-dns(no); };
    ```

- Objects can be used before definition.

- Objects can be defined inline as well. This is useful if you use the
    object only once (for example, a filter).

- To add comments to the configuration file, start a line with \# and
    write your comments. These lines are ignored by {{ site.product.short_name }}.

    ```config
    # Comment: This is a stream source

    source s_demo_stream {
    unix-stream("<path-to-socket>" max-connections(10) group(log)); };
    ```

The syntax of log statements is as follows:

```config
log {
    source(s1); source(s2); ...
    optional_element(filter1|parser1|rewrite1);
    optional_element(filter2|parser2|rewrite2);
    ...
    destination(d1); destination(d2); ...
    flags(flag1[, flag2...]);
};
```

The following log statement sends all messages arriving to the localhost
to a remote server.

```config
source s_localhost { network(ip(127.0.0.1) port(1999)); };
destination d_tcp { network("10.1.2.3" port(1999) localport(999)); };
log { source(s_localhost); destination(d_tcp); };
```

The {{ site.product.short_name }} application has a number of global options governing
DNS usage, the timestamp format used, and other general points. Each
option may have parameters, similarly to driver specifications. To set
global options add an option statement to the {{ site.product.short_name }}
configuration file using the following syntax:

```config
options { option1(params); option2(params); ... };
```

For example:

To disable domain name resolving, add the following line to the
{{ site.product.short_name }} configuration file:

```config
options { use-dns(no); };
```
