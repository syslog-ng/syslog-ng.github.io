    This could help common link usages, like

    {% include doc/common_links %}
    [404 link via ref][ref:404]

    The final goal would be to add include of this file to _includes/doc/common_snippets and get it
    automatically included to each page, so make possible pure 

    [404 link via ref][ref:404]

    usage.

    Currently we have issues with this construct (see _includes/doc/common_snippets for more)
